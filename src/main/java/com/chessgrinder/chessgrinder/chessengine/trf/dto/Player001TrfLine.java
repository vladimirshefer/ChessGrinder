 *           This is the number of points in the tournament
 *           standings, which depends on the scoring
 *           points system used and on the value of the
 *           pairing-allocated bye (usually the same as a
 *           win). If, for instance, the 3/1/0 scoring
 *           point system is applied
 *           in a tournament and a
 *           player scored 5 wins, 2 draws and 2 losses,
 *           this field should contain "17.0"
 * 86 - 89   Rank Exact definition, especially for Team         ■
